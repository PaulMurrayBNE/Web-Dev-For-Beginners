# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
|Explained why web developer would use tool| Explained how, but not why developer would use tool| Did not mention how or why a developer would use tool  |

## My Answers

Do these go here? This is all a bit confusing.

Three tools of a type not covered? So, not a linter, nor a node package manager, nor a formatter, nor an editor?

<h2>1 Minify</h2>
Takes whitespace and similar out of your files. This reduces file size and therefore load times etc. without affecting the performance of the code. It makes for light faster code, which is why you might use it. Some people might cynically say that there is little to no evidence that anyone cares about file sizes and that Minfy is really about obfuscation and making your code hard to read. That would be cynical. However, it is a good idea to hold off on minyfying until you're sure you won't need to read your own code.

<h2>2 Git</h2>
Version control tool. Well, a family of tools, but I think you can host git yourself. You can use them to keep track of and control changes. That's useful for working in teams, or for working from different sites / on different machines. Even individuals benefit from keeping on top of what changes have been made. Why not pick GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket? They're the only three I know of, but we aren't allowed to use the same examples as MDN, so I'm saying plain Git. Real reasons for Git over say GitHub? Maybe you get a bit spooked by changes in ownership and control and, while you really like free private repos, you don't entirely trust MS to keep things that way? I'm pretty sure most people are very happy to use GitHub in real life though.

<h2>3 Bootstrap</h2>
A CSS and JS framework. Frameworks let you do things with HTML / CSS / JS without reinventing the wheel. Someone else has probably already designed a drop-down navigation bar that does everything you want one to do. Sure, you know enough to build one from scratch, but Bootstrap is much quicker. The extra load times and bandwidth use? See above re Minify.
